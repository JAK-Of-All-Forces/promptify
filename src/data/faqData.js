        question: "Why create Promptify?",
        answer: "As college students, interns, and people who can not go a day without listening to music, we created Promptify to revolutionize the way people experience music on Spotify. We noticed that while Spotify offers a vast library of music, it often lacks the personal touch needed to truly connect with listeners. And you might say, why not just set aside the time to create a playlist before you go to your activity? And the truth is, often or not we have little personal time to do so no matter how much we would like to. So our goal was to develop a platform that not only understands individual musical preferences but also saves it's user's personal time. By using AI to analyze listening habits, we aim to provide a more engaging and personalized music experience that feels like it was made just for you. Promptify is our answer to the need for a smarter, more intuitive way to enjoy music, making every playlist feel like a perfect fit for your current mood or activity."
