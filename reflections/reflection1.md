## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We have successfully completed our user authentication through Spotify. This was a major full stack feature that needed to be completed and it is now fully functional. In turn it also allows us to now parse through our logged in users data. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

The Spotify and OpenAI API are brand new APIs that we’ve been learning and experiencing for the past week. Often or not we run into blockers and errors due to incorrect implementation of one of the API’s such as Jessica and Amari sharing the same Spotify API’s not knowing that we needed individual developer API’s. All of this has been a learning experience for us and integration of the two is definitely what will continue to take some time for us. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

No, we did not finish all of our tasks for this first Sprint. We still need to complete some full stack features such as displaying the users old playlists created through us as well as completing our activity button for our prompt page. I think how we’ll move into Sprint 2 is definitely prioritizing completing our Prompt page as it’s our main feature especially with communicating with the open AI api. We go in with a full stack approach for every single feature on our web application so sometimes certain features take longer than others to complete. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We spend a lot of time planning with our mentors and we set a lot of time aside last week to mitigate how we want this spring to go. We utilized Trello, the tags, the checkboxes in each task to help us break down what we needed to work on. We also utilized Slack a lot to communicate issues, PRs, and send code that was in our Git Ignore. We also utilized the Chrome Dev Tools for frontend testing to track what our variables, page layouts, and states were looking like.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We do not think that any of the user stories are at risk. We will be able to hit all the user stories we defined last week with little to no problem. We plan to start next week with deploying on Render as well as finishing the full stack connection of the Prompt Page, which are the most strenuous tasks.
