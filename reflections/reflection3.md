## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to implement our new stats page that shows the user's top artists, playlists, genres, and tracks across 4 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. We also had very minimal merge conflicts demonstrating how we have gotten the hang of a Github workflow.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 A challenge we are facing is that the Spotify API has relatively strict API rate limits that are stopping generation of some of the things we need to populate the database. We plan to take some extra time after work to add error handling and optimize calls to the Spotify API.
 
* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We have not finished all tasks in our sprint. We plan to prioritize making sure we have displaying images on the stats page and that no loading state lasts more than 30 seconds.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The resources provieded that helped the most this week were simply the instructors. For example, Keith helped us with a website for web design inspiration called Dribble. Alex, helped a lot with prompt engineering using ChatGPT or CoPilot for deep and verbose errors. Paige gave a lot of helpful feedback on how to navigate developer terms concerning AI Ethics that the Spotify API had. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We think the that Stats Page is at risk if the images do not display. If they remain at risk, we will jsut remove the page from the main branch.
